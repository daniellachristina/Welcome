This is a place to showcase my newly developed skills in digital archaeology, I hope you enjoy looking through my projects. Follow me on twitter http://twitter.com/digiarch2017 :sparkles:

## Portfolio project II

Following the theme "the bones of our past" from the heritage jam contest, I have decided to focus on the topic of domestication for my second portfolio project. I will be analysing archaeological findings surrounding the domestication of dogs, pigs, and cows. I will also be creating maps pinpointing important findings and early domestication locations.
