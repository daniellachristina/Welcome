## A digital achaeology portfolio

Hello and Welcome to my blog. As technology advances, the methodolgies archaeologists use to share their data does as well. This is a place to showcase my newly developed skills in digital archaeology, I hope you enjoy looking through my projects.

A little something

## Portfolio project II

Following the theme "the bones of our past" from the heritage jam contest, I have decided to focus on the topic of domestication for my second portfolio project. I will be analysing archaeological findings surrounding the domestication of animals and the places they emerged from.  

## The Archaeology of Animal Domestication

"Animal domestication is the most important development in the past 13,000 years of human history. It interests all of us, scientists and non-scientists alike, because it provides most of our food today, it was prerequisite to the rise of civilization." - Jared Diamond

## Story Map JS

I've utlized Story Map JS to indicate the geographical locations of animal domestication around the world. Included are the sites of dog, cattle, pig, guinea pig, and chicken domestication. I think this my favourite visualization tool, as it allows for easy editing, custom photo uploads, and most importantly, allows for the added description of the points located on the map. I'm very pleased with how this turned out! 

## Timeline JS

Starting at the first known instance of a morphologically different wolf like animal in the pleistocene and ending with the discovery of a fully domesticated dog skeleton being unearthed in a grave with a human, this timeline represents the important dates indicated by archaeologists for dog domestication. I think the timeline js works really well with my project, as it allows for the visualization of qualitative data quite well. 

## Voyant

### Cirrus Word Bubble

### Trends and Corpus

I've used voyant to analyze the texts of two archeological articles analysing data concerning the domestication of dogs. While I prefer the aesthic properties of the cirrus word bubble more, I think the Trends and Corpus graph visualizes the data input better. The data I used was two archaeological articles examining the mitochodrial DNA and ancestral lineages of modern dogs in Europe, Central Asia, and South East Asia. I like how the Trends and Corpus displays the data due to the qualitive nature of it, I like how it denotes 'breeds', 'ancient', and 'modern'.

Self reflection:

I really enjoyed creating this portfolio, despit a few challenges along the way. Voyant espicially did not want to embed properly, and I initially had it on my website as a static image using the HTML image code. This did however give me a chance to learn a bit more HTML, so that's good. 
I think the story map js and timeline js visualize the data I have chosen for this project fairly well. If I were to re-do this project, I would focus more on data collection first and foremost, and then try to build my visualizations, as I think I was too focussed on trying to find the 'right' platforms to present my data. This would have prepared me for all of the problems I encountered along the way (quadrigram and gephi kept crashing, and I was unable to embed my carto map into my portfolio in time for this project) so I had to come up with alternatives that did not visualize my initial data in the ways I had intitailly intended. I'm still happy with how my visuals turned out despite this, and I'm glad they embedded properly.  
Overall I think the general success of this project can be determined by what I initially set out to do, which was to create visual archaeology that can be used as a teaching tool for elementary school aged children. I think children are naturally drawn to animals, and discovering how the most common species came to be throughout the course of human history would be a great way to introduce them to archaeology. I was mainly inspired by the maps and tables that engrossed me as a child, and chose a colour scheme and pictures that fit a younger audience.
