## Portfolio project II

Following the theme "the bones of our past" from the heritage jam contest, I have decided to focus on the topic of domestication for my second portfolio project. I will be analysing archaeological findings surrounding the domestication of dogs, pigs, and cows. I will also be creating maps pinpointing important findings and early domestication locations.

**Visualisation description**

Using an article initially published in Archaeology Magazine [Link to Archaeology Archive!] (https://archive.archaeology.org/1009/dogs/) on the archeology of dog domestication, this visual represents the instances of the words we associate with dog domestication, such as the obviuos 'dogs' and 'wolves', but is also enriched by the inclusion of 'agriculture', 'companions', 'humans', and 'cultures.'
