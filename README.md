## A digital achaeology portfolio

Hello and Welcome to my blog. As technology advances, the methodolgies archaeologists use to share their data does as well. This is a place to showcase my newly developed skills in digital archaeology, I hope you enjoy looking through my projects.

A little something

Dog bones! from the University of Alberta Archives

## Portfolio project II

Following the theme "the bones of our past" from the heritage jam contest, I have decided to focus on the topic of domestication for my second portfolio project. I will be analysing archaeological findings surrounding the domestication of animals and the places they emerged from.  


## Story Map JS

I've utlized Story Map JS to locate sites of animal domestication around the world. Included are the sites of dog, cattle, pig, guinea pig, and chicken domestication. I think this my favourite visualization tool, as it allows for easy editing, custom photo uploads, and most importantly, allows for the added description of the points located on the map. I'm very pleased with how this turned out! 

## Timeline JS

Starting at the first known instance of a morphologically different wolf like animal in the pleistocene and ending with the discovery of a fully domesticated dog skeleton being unearthed in a grave with a human, this timeline represents the important dates indicated by archaeologists for dog domestication. I think the timeline js works really well with my project, as it allows for the visualization of qualitative data quite well.

I've used voyant to analyze the texts of two archeological articles analysing data concerning the domestication of dogs. The cirrus word bubble allows for us to look at how certain subjects are talked about, and in this case, how archaeologist breech the subject of domestication. While I found voyant to be the least useful method of data visualization for my project, I think it would really well if 
I were visualizing quantifiable data.
